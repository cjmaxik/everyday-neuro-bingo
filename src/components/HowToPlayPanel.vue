        Examine the board before the stream. It has 25 or 48 randomly generated prompts that we expect <span
          class="text-gymbag text-bold"
        >Neuro-sama</span> or her partners to say, do, or mention. Once they do, click on the appropriate prompt to mark
        it out. Mind the color of the prompts: collab streams have separate prompts for each partner.
        <strong>Bingo</strong> is complete when all seven prompts in the vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row are marked
        out. The center prompt is free, by the way.

        You don't win anything by playing this Bingo. It's just for fun. Your board is randomly generated specifically for
        you. If you are not sure if the prompt needs to be marked out, ask your fellow viewers.

        Hit <span class="text-bold">Fullscreen Board <q-icon name="fullscreen" /></span> to have the board fully occupy
        the screen - it makes for a better experience on mobile/touch devices.
      </p>

      <p class="no-margin">
        In the <span class="text-bold">Settings <q-icon name="settings" /></span> you can disable the font, disable the
        sounds, show the tally, and change the emote styles. Settings and the current board states are stored on the
        device.
