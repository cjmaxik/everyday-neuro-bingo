1. Wrap the emote name in `:`, like `:KEKW:` (case-sensitive, same as on 7tv)
2. Go to https://7tv.app/emotes and search for an emote
3. Copy the emote ID (random text at the end of URL)
4. Paste the info in `emotesList.json`
5. Run `npm run emotePrep` to obtain new emotes
6. Use `/emoteTest` board to evaluate the result
Please keep the list in alphabetical order.
